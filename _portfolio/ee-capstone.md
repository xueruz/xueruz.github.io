title: "IC Design for 5 GHz Wi-Fi Radio Frequency Receiver Front-end"
excerpt: "**Abstract:** The objective of this project is to design and tape-out a working radio frequency (RF) front-end of a 5 GHz Wi-Fi receiver chip with a focus on linearity. Due to the significance of signal integrity, the receiver must be linear enough so that there is minimum distortion and power loss. Using the 130 nm SKY130 PDK in collaboration with NYDesign's I.C. program, Efabless, the blocks of the front-end (low-noise amplifier, mixer, oscillator) were simulated individually and as an overall system. While the simulation results for the overall system were not very promising, the individual blocks show comparable results (to existing designs) across parameters such as gain, linearity, noise and power. For next steps, we plan on designing a PCB to test the chips when they arrive."

For our senior capstone project, we worked with [Efabless](https://efabless.com/) to design and tape-out a 5 GHz Wi-Fi RF receiver front-end. This project was advised by [Professor Koo](https://cooper.edu/academics/people/ja-beom-koo) and [Professor Shlayan](https://cooper.edu/academics/people/neveen-shlayan).

Note: The order of names on either the poster and the report are **not** by prominence, although it is good to note that David Yang volunteered to be the chip captain and led the team during the layout and tapeout process! 

In the future, I plan to test the chips (as I am the only one in the group still at The Cooper Union!) when they are fabricated and delivered to us.

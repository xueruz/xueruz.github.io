## About Me 👩🏻‍🎓
🔬 I am pursuing a Master's in Electrical Engineering following my undergraduate education at [The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art](https://cooper.edu/welcome). **My work is on optimizing the power consumption and bandwidth of a quadrature phase generator for wireless communication.** I am advised by [Dr. Jabeom Koo](https://cooper.edu/academics/people/ja-beom-koo) and I aim to complete my thesis by May 2024. 

📚 Currently, I am taking classes in Medical Imaging and Remote Sensing (analyzing satellite imagery), where I hone my image processing skills. On the side, I grade work for the undergraduate Circuit Analysis class that Professor Koo teaches.

🛜 My main research interest is in **Analog Radio Frequency Design**. I wish to pursue a PhD to delve deeper into this field and accomplish meaningful research in academia!

🤓 Recent non-academic interests: _The Three Body Problem_ science-fiction trilogy, interior design in The Sims 4, and cinnamon banana almond protein shakes

## Recent News 🎉
📡 I finished my second summer at Persistent Systems, LLC in NYC, where I worked with engineers in the lab to characterize the power supply of prototype main boards, debug voltage rail issues, write automation scripts, design and run testing matrices among a handful of things. 

🎓 In May 2023, [I graduated](https://cooper.edu/gallery/commencement-2023#img_gallery-15) Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.

👩🏻‍💻 I finally decided to take that leap and create my personal website -- I've been wanting to do this for a long time now! More to come soon.

<p>👩🏻‍🎓 I am a Master's student in Electrical Engineering following my undergraduate education at [The Cooper Union](https://cooper.edu/welcome), working on optimizing the power consumption and bandwidth of a quadrature phase generator for wireless communication. My work is advised by (Professor Jabeom Koo)[https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=SQ9yG6wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate] and I aim to complete my thesis by May 2024. Currently, I am taking classes in Medical Imaging and Remote Sensing (analyzing satellite imagery), where I hone my image processing skills. On the side, I grade work for the undergraduate Circuit Analysis class that Professor Koo teaches.</p>
  
<p>📰 Some recent news: I finished my second summer interning at Persistent Systems, LLC in NYC, where I had a great time working with engineers in the lab to characterize the power supply of prototype main boards, debug voltage rail issues, write automation scripts, design and run testing matrices among a handful of things. In May 2023, I graduated Magna Cum Laude with my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.</p>

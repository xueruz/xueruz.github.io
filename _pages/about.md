## About Me 👩🏻‍🎓
I am pursuing a Master's in Electrical Engineering following my undergraduate education at [The Cooper Union](https://cooper.edu/welcome). **My work is on optimizing the power consumption and bandwidth of a quadrature phase generator for wireless communication.** I am advised by [Dr. Jabeom Koo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=SQ9yG6wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and I aim to complete my thesis by May 2024. 

Currently, I am taking classes in Medical Imaging and Remote Sensing (analyzing satellite imagery), where I hone my image processing skills. On the side, I grade work for the undergraduate Circuit Analysis class that Professor Koo teaches.

My main research interest is in Analog RF Design. I wish to pursue a PhD to delve deeper into this field and accomplish meaningful research! 

## Recent News 🗞️
I finished my second summer (third internship) interning at Persistent Systems, LLC in NYC, where I worked with engineers in the lab to characterize the power supply of prototype main boards, debug voltage rail issues, write automation scripts, design and run testing matrices among a handful of things. 

In May 2023, [I graduated](https://cooper.edu/gallery/commencement-2023#img_gallery-15) Magna Cum Laude with my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.
